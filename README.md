# All-SQL
the repository of my SQL code (old projects from class and personal project endeavour)

First initial project was the desgin of a entity relationship diagram (ERD) which was made via draw.io. I didnt find it imoprtant to include.

Seond project was creating a schema and inserting data into tables upon professors instructions.

Third project practiced our knowldege on normalization. We were to first alter a new ERD, by spotting transitive and partial dependencies to bring the orignal SQL script into 3NF. 

Final project consisted of our knowledge of stored procedures and also connecting to JDBC we were to create a GUI.
